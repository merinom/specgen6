    <h2 id="intro">1 Introduction</h2>

    <p>The following specification is a formal description of metadata schema proposal that can be applied to data gathered in the so-called Idea Management Systems. The goal of the following section is to introduce both Semantic Web and Idea Management experts to the topic and goals of the ontology and provide the basic knowledge to comprehand the technical part of the specification.</p>
    <p><b>An important note</b> is that GI2MO ontology is not a complete model of the Idea Management System. It merly defines concepts that are not described yet by the means of other ontologies. For detailed instructions how to completly model Idea Management Systems with GI2MO and other ontologies see <a href="http://purl.org/gi2mo/modeling/">homepage</a> of the GI2MO project.</p>

    <h3 id="s11">1.1 Idea Management Systems and Innovation Management Process</h3>

    <p>The Idea Management Systems are refered most often as an application used by organizations to collect input about various ideas regarding their products and services; and manage them afterwards providing certain assessment and screening facilities.
    </p>    
    <p>
    Although, the concept of such systems and vendors that deliver them are available on the market for quite a while, the scope and technologies involved are constantly evolving. The most most basic idea management process includes: 
    <ul>
    <li>idea generation (facilities for submiting ideas)</li>
    <li>idea improvement (usually Web 2.0 facilities to modify ideas in collaboratibve environment)</li>
    <li>idea assessment (idea analysis, assessment and selection tools, e.g. diagrams and reports)</li>
    </ul>
    However, in the contemporary systems the tendency is to extend this process towards: 
    <ul>
    <li>idea implementation (lightweight project management tools or integration with more complex suits)</li>
    <li>idea deployment (analysis of business metrics related to products based on ideas from IM process, e.g. ROI)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <b>In relation to other IT systems used in modern organizations</b>, at the time of writing this specification the IM Systems have not been yet introducted as a standard compotent by the key players as part of their ERP, PLM/PLCM or CRM suites. Idea Management, in relation to those systems, is still being considered as a rising market and a complementary solution that can be supplied depending on organization's interest in investment in innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
    <b>In relation to other processes run in the modern enterprises</b>, Idea Management can be defined as part of Innovation Management Process run as part of innovation strategy in many contemporary enterprises. Idea Management is percieved as complementary solution to this process that delivers tools that can enhance the successfulness of the innovation management process and open it to new possibilities.
    </p>
    </p>

    <h3 id="s12">1.2 The Semantic Web</h3>

    <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/">Semantic Web</a> is a W3C initiative that aims to introduce rich metadata to the current Web and provide machine readable and processable data as a supplement to human-readable Web.
    </p>
    <p>
    Semantic Web is a mature domain that has been in research phase for many years and with the increasing amount of commercial interest and emerging products is starting to gain appreciation and popularity as one of the rising trends for the future Internet.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    One of the corner stores of the Semantic Web is research on inerlinkable and interoperable data schemas for information published online. Those schemas are often refered to as ontologies or vocabularies. In order to facilitate the concept of ontologies that lead to a truly interoperable Web of Data, W3C has proposed a series of technologies such as <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-overview/">OWL</a>.
    <b>GI2MO</b> uses those technologies and the research that comes within to propose an ontology set in the domain of Idea Management.
    </p>

    <h3 id="s13">1.3 What is GI2MO for?</h3>
    <p>
    The goals of the GI2MO ontology to achieve as a data schema are:
    <ul>
    <li>enable to publish raw data from Idea Management Systems online and in complience with current and future Internet trends</li>
    <li>interconnect Idea Management assets with other resources (projects, product metrics, basic knowledge management concepts)</li>
    <li>utilize all above to enhance current idea assessment capabilities with algorithms based on analysis of rich semantic descriptions of idea management assets</li>
    </ul>

      (relationships, attributes), are given below. All the terms are hyperlinked

    <h3 id="s31">3.1. Referenced Namespaces</h3>
    <p>
    A common practice in Semantic Web domain is to take advantage of the work previously done and model new domains with the use of widely known and well established vocabularies. This practice simplifies the vocabulary pool, allows to establish naming standards and implement better interoperability and data portability across potentially very different systems.
    </p>
    <p>
    Within GI2MO project we attempted to follow those rules and part of the Idea Management System model has been described with the use of other ontologies. As a result, some of the classes and properties defined in this specification have references to properties from other ontologies to indicate point of connection. Those referenced ontologies are described with the following namespaces:

<h2 id="sec-extrefs">External Vocabulary References</h2>

<p>
The description of the terms in the <em>Ordered List Ontology</em> 'dictionary' make reference to classes and properties elsewhere. This section of the <em>Ordered List Ontology</em> 
specification provides a placeholder reference for any <em>Ordered List Ontology</em> mention of externally defined terms. For example, sometimes we might say that <em>Ordered List Ontology</em> property has 
a domain or range of an externally defined class, or that a <em>Ordered List Ontology</em> class is a sub-class of an external class, or 'disjoint with' such a class (ie. has no 
common members). Such claims help fix the intended meaning of <em>Ordered List Ontology</em> terms in relationship to other 'peer' vocabularies.
Currently, the <em>Ordered List Ontology</em> sub classes:</p>
<dl>
<dt><a about="http://purl.org/ontology/olo/core#" rel="rdfs:seeAlso" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-owl-ref-20040210/#Class">owl:Thing</a></dt>
<dd>The class extension of owl:Thing is the set of all individuals.
</dd>
</dl>


<h3 id="extns_status">Status Vocabulary</h3>

<p>
Each term in the <em>Ordered List Ontology</em> is annotated with properties from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/06/sw-vocab-status/note">SemWeb Vocab Status Ontology</a>
</p>
<p>
Note that this mechanism is itself somewhat experimental and evolvin. The definitions of 'stable', 'unstable', 'archaic' and 'testing' cannot
 be defined as global absolutes, but only in relationship to the practices, expectations and social structures around some vocabulary. For their use in 
 the <em>Ordered List Ontology</em>, future versions of this specification could usefully offer more detail about what to expect from a term labelled 'stable'. 
 </p>

<dl>
<dt>vs:term_status</dt>
<dd>The vs:term_status property indicates the status of a vocabulary term, one of 'stable','unstable','testing' or 'archaic'. </dd>
</dl>

  <h3 id="sec-ack">Acknowledgments</h3>

  <p>I would like to thank very much Samer A. Abdallah (!), Yves Raimond, Kurt Jacbson and Aldo Gangemi
 to help to establish this multiple purpose ordered list ontology. Furthermore, Dan Brickley and Libby Miller to provide the basis for this
specification.</p>
